# Cotton-Disease-Prediction

<ul>
  <li>Created a web app that determines a leaf/plant as diseased/normal.</li>
  <li>The dataset consists of 4 categories: diseased cotton leaf, diseased cotton plant,fresh cotton leaf, fresh cotton plant</li>
  <li>I had used the traditional CNN method and achieved an accuracy of 82%. Again I took the help of Transfer Learning and had applied the ResNet152V2 model for my dataset and got an accuracy of 98% for 20 epochs. </li>
</ul>
